# quetzalcoatlus

![Quetzalcoatlus](resources/images/quetzalcoatlus_1298px.jpg "QuetzalCoatlus")

A Qt-based 'proving-grounds' application to exercise interesting or re-usable parts of Qt, C++17, C++ build strategies (CMake/Makefile), deployment strategies on multiple platforms, including the Docker approach for cross-compilation.

This application is an attempt to preserve the random bits and pieces of advice collected over multiple projects into a (hopefully)cohesive project.
